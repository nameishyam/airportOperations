**Airport Operations
Project Description: Airport Operations Management System**

The Airport Operations Management System is a Java-based project that aims to streamline and manage various operations within an airport. The project employs the concept of packages to organize and modularize the code for better maintainability. The system encompasses essential airport functions, including viewing current flights, ticket booking, security checks, and check-in procedures.

**Components of the Project:**

**Airport Operations Package:**

**AirportMain.java:** The main driver class that orchestrates the entire system. It provides a user interface to select different airport operations.
**FlightTicketPrinter.java:** Manages the ticket booking functionality. It allows users to input passenger details, select available flights, and generates boarding passes.
**Security Check Package:**

**SecurityCheck.java:** A module to perform security checks. The security check is a placeholder in the current project and can be extended to include real security checks based on specific criteria.
**Check-in Package:**

**CheckInSystem.java:** Manages the check-in process. Passengers can check-in, and the system verifies their details against the flight information.
**Key Features:**

**Modular Code Organization:**

The project uses packages to organize code logically, making it modular and easy to understand.
Each package corresponds to a specific functionality, such as airport operations, security checks, and check-in procedures.
**User-Friendly Interface:**

The main class, AirportMain.java, provides a user-friendly interface with a menu to choose from various airport operations.
Users can view current flights, book tickets, undergo security checks, and complete the check-in process.
Ticket Booking Functionality:

The FlightTicketPrinter.java module allows users to input passenger details, view available flights, and generate boarding passes.
Flight details, including departure and arrival times, are randomly generated for illustration purposes.
**Security Check Placeholder:**

The SecurityCheck.java module serves as a placeholder for the security check process. It can be extended to include actual security measures based on the airport's requirements.
**Check-in Process:**
The CheckInSystem.java module manages the check-in process. Passengers can input their details, and the system verifies the information against available flight data.


**Usage:**

Run AirportMain.java to start the Airport Operations Management System.
Choose from the menu options to perform different airport operations.
Follow the prompts to input necessary information for ticket booking, security checks, and check-in.
